# GM-Personal-Training

GM-Personal-Training is a site made for the code institute Full Stack Developers milestone project. the purpose of this site is to provide an online platform where signed up users can buy products to help with their fitness and also book personal training sessions through a contact form. 

## UX

Pages on this site include a products page, cart, checkout, class booking, login and registration page. All pages are easily accessible through the well laid out and clean nav bar however some pages require you to be logged in for access for example the classes page.

The home page for this site is the products page were everything GM-Personal-Training wants to sell will be displayed professionally and with details on each product including name, price, image and description of that product. The buyer then selects the quantity of that product they would like to buy and adds it to their cart. If the buyer is struggling to find what they are looking for then they can use the filter application to either search for a specific product or narrow down their choices using the categories filter.

Once the item is added to the cart, the cart page will then display that same item along with the quantity the buyer has chosen and the total price of all items added together. here they have a chance to amend their quantity if they need or can move on to the checkout page.

In the checkout page there is a payment form and an order form which allows the user to pay online and have the product delivered to them. All the products are once again displayed for the buyer to see however by this point, they cannot amend the quantity unless they go back a page.

If the user is looking to book a personal training session with GM-Personal-Training they can do this in the classes page. A user must be logged in to access this page but once logged in it then allows them access to contact GM-Personal-Training to book a session.

## Features 

this site has login, logout and registration features that allow the user access to different areas of the site and its features. The user also has the ability to change their password if they have previously forgotten it by using email.

This site allows people to find products easily using the search feature on the products page. A personal trainer could recommend a specific product and this feature makes it easy for the user to find said product.

The categories filter helps those users just looking to browse narrow down the product range to what they came to see. They can narrow down the products to just for men/women or equipment which means the site can display a wide variety of products but make it still easy for a user to find what they are looking for.

The site allows users to select a quantity of products which is good for the business and user as it's easy to work with and creates potential for GM-Personal-Training to sell higher amounts.

The checkout page is linked with Stripe which allows user to pay safely for their product and knowing all their payment details will be handled with securely and privately.

The classes page contact form is clearly laid out using Django forms for a professional look. When completed the information is put through emailjs to then send an email to GM-Personal-Training that is well formatted and easy to read displaying who sent it and what their request was.

Also, on the classes there is a map displaying clearly where GM-Personal-Training is based using the google my maps API feature.

## Future Features

In the future I wish to have more ways to filter down the products for example by price or by colour. 

I also aim to add a calendar that displays available time slots for a user to book a session straight away and then also pay straight away rather than contact through email services.
